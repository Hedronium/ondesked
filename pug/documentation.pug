                h1#introduction Introduction

                p.
                    Ondesked is a markup language which is used for developing GUI for desktop apps.
                p.
                    It's based on XML, and is similar to HTML; if you know HTML, you already know some of Ondesked.
                p
                    | Every Ondesked document should have an 
                    code app
                    |  element as the root element. Just like this:

                pre
                    code.xml
                        = '<app>...</app>'

                p
                    | You can think of it as equivalent to an 
                    code html
                    |  tag.

                p
                    | Ondesked is designed to be strict, to prevent any unexpected behavior, and to keep codes consistent.
                p
                    | So, every Ondesked document should start with 
                    code app
                    |  tag, otherwise it just won't work.


                h1#app App

                p
                    | App, as the name explains, represents the app that you're building.

                p
                    | As mentioned in the previous heading, the
                    code app
                    |  element should be at the root of the document.

                p
                    |  Syntax:

                pre

                        = '<app>...</app>'
